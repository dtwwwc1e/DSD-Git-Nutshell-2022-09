## Solution

No. Alfredo does not need to make the `cocktails` sub-directory a Git repository 
because the `recipes` repository will track all files, sub-directories, and 
sub-directory files under the `recipes` directory.  Thus, in order to track 
all information about cocktails, Alfredo only needed to add the `cocktails` sub-directory
to the `recipes` directory.

Additionally, Git repositories can interfere with each other if they are "nested":
the outer repository will try to version-control
the inner repository. Therefore, it's best to create each new Git
repository in a separate directory. To be sure that there is no conflicting
repository in the directory, check the output of `git status`. If it looks
like the following, you are good to go to create a new repository as shown
above:

```shell
$ git status
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```
