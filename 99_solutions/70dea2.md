## Solution -- USE WITH CAUTION!

### Background

Removing files from a git repository needs to be done with caution. To remove
files from the working tree and not from your working directory, use

```shell
$ rm filename
```

The file being removed has to be in sync with the branch head with no updates.
If there are updates, the file can be removed by force by using the `-f` option.
Similarly a directory can be removed from git using `rm -r dirname` or `rm -rf
dirname`.

### Solution

Git keeps all of its files in the `.git` directory. To recover from this little
mistake, Alfredo can just remove the `.git` folder in the cocktails subdirectory by
running the following command from inside the `recipes` directory:

```shell
$ rm -rf cocktails/.git
```

But be careful! Running this command in the wrong directory, will remove the
entire Git history of a project you might want to keep. Therefore, always check
your current directory using the command `pwd`.
